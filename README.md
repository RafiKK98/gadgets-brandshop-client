# Gadgets Brand Shop site using React, React router, Firebase and MongoDB


Features:

- In this site, you can view the brand specific products by clicking any of the brands in the section below the slider in the home page.
- To Add products or view your shopping cart, you have to be logged in either by email-password or by using your google account.
- One of the brands do not have any products available here (Oppo here in this case).
- Adding a product in the add-product form, updating an existing product, adding a product in a cart or deleting a product from cart opens up a Sweatalert popup. Same happens for the newsletter section when you subscribe to the newsletter using an email account.
- Dark mode implemented for the home page which can be toggled from the toggle switch left to the login button/profile avatar (while logged in)
